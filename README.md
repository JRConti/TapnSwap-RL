# TapnSwap - Reinforcement Learning

### Jean-Remy Conti, ENS Paris-Saclay (France), 2020

This a personal project I did during the COVID-19 pandemic. It is based on a game I would often play with friends. An optimal policy is learned via Q-learning and the user may play against the trained agent (difficult level choice).


## Requirements

* Python
* Python basic libraries: numpy, os, time, matplotlib

## Run the game 

Clone this repository and run `main.py`.

```
git clone https://github.com/JRConti/TapnSwap-RL
python TapnSwap-RL/main.py
```

The file `main.py` launches the game only, not the training part.
